neimap: Interactive BGP neighbor map
---

Yet another "Oh this class is so damn boring I got to find something to do" project.

This is an interactive BGP neighbor relationship map. It uses [RIPE Stat API](https://stat.ripe.net/docs/data_api) to obtain BGP neighbor information. 

To use it, visit [lab.nat.moe/neimap](http://lab.nat.moe/neimap/index.html). Supply an ASN to get started, then click on any node to draw their neighbors on the map. Alternatively, hit Enter to add ASN to map.
